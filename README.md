## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/customer-churn-prediction
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### 1. Training the Model

To retrain the model with the existing data:

```bash
cd src
python3 train_models.py
```

This will:
- Load and split the preprocessed data
- Train 5 different models
- Compare their performance
- Save the best model
- Generate visualization plots

#### 2. Making Predictions

Use the prediction script to predict churn for new customers:

```bash
cd src
python3 predict.py
```

Example output:
```
‚úì Model and scaler loaded successfully!
  Model: Gradient Boosting
  ROC-AUC Score: 0.8706

Sample Predictions:
======================================================================
 Customer_Index  Churn_Prediction  Churn_Probability Risk_Level
              0                 0           0.310409        Low
              1                 0           0.212731        Low
              2                 1           0.938870       High
...
======================================================================
```

#### 3. Custom Predictions

To make predictions on your own data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import joblib
import json

# Load model and scaler
model = joblib.load('models/best_churn_model.pkl')
scaler = joblib.load('models/scaler.pkl')

# Load your preprocessed data
# Make sure it has the same features as training data
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(data)
probabilities = model.predict_proba(data)[:, 1]

# Interpret results
for i, (pred, prob) in enumerate(zip(predictions, probabilities)):
    risk = 'High' if prob > 0.7 else 'Medium' if prob > 0.4 else 'Low'
    print(f"Customer {i}: {'Will Churn' if pred == 1 else 'Will Stay'} - "
          f"Probability: {prob:.2%} - Risk: {risk}")
```

## üîç Model Details

### Gradient Boosting (Best Model)

The Gradient Boosting model was selected as the best performer with:
- **87.06% ROC-AUC**: Excellent discrimination between churners and non-churners
- **86.81% Accuracy**: High overall correctness
- **78.35% Precision**: When predicting churn, correct 78% of the time
- **48.77% Recall**: Identifies 49% of actual churners

### Why Gradient Boosting?

- Best overall ROC-AUC score among all tested models
- Good balance between precision and recall
- Handles feature interactions effectively
- Robust to overfitting with proper regularization

## üí° Business Insights

Based on the model analysis:

1. **Age is Critical**: Older customers (40+) are more likely to churn
   - *Action*: Develop retention programs for senior customers

2. **Product Portfolio Matters**: Customers with 1 or 3+ products show higher churn
   - *Action*: Focus on cross-selling to reach 2 products per customer

3. **Inactive Members**: Non-active members have significantly higher churn rates
   - *Action*: Implement engagement campaigns for inactive users

4. **Geographic Differences**: German customers show different churn patterns
   - *Action*: Tailor retention strategies by region

5. **Account Balance**: Customers with very low or very high balances may churn
   - *Action*: Monitor extreme balance changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.13**: Programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and tools
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting implementation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Joblib**: Model serialization
